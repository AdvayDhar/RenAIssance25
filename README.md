# RenAIssance25
RenAIssance Document synthesis using custom pipeline




## Abstract

This project aims to synthesize Renaissance-era texts and stylize them into images, combining text generation with image manipulation techniques. The main goal is to create a seamless pipeline where synthetic LLM-generated texts and/or user-inputted texts are automatically transformed into old-style text, mimicking the look and feel of Renaissance manuscripts. 

### Approach

1. **Font Generation**:
   - **.ttf File Creation**: Develop a custom TrueType font (TTF) based on historical manuscripts. We will use image segmentation and OCR (character-only) recognition models to extract and replicate the printing style, including defects like slightly tilted or misprinted characters.
   - The font will capture the exact printing style, imperfections, and various embellishments commonly found in Renaissance manuscripts.

2. **Image Chunks for Embellishments**:
   - **Decorative Elements**: Separate image chunks will be created for embellishments such as margin designs and decorative initial characters, which can be added where needed.

3. **Material Degradation Simulation**:
   - **GAN Models**: We will utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to simulate material degradation like yellowing, creasing, ink blotches, and wear and tear typical of old manuscripts. This includes the use of CycleGAN, StyleGAN, or Stable Diffusion models for img2img transformations.

4. **Ink Blotches and Other Defects**:
   - **Image Processing**: Use image processing techniques and machine learning models to simulate ink blotches, paper folds, and other imperfections like rotated text or reverse page prints.

### Benefits to the Open Source Community

This project aims to make it easier to digitize and recreate Renaissance-era written content for educational, artistic, and historical purposes. By leveraging machine learning and image processing, this tool provides several key benefits:

- **Historians and Educators**: Create documents that reflect the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of the Renaissance period.
- **Artists**: Generate stylized texts that mimic historical manuscript styles.
- **Open Source Community**: Develop tools that automate text generation and stylization, reducing barriers for those without artistic skills to create historical-style documents.

## Deliverables

### 1. **Text Synthesis Tool**:
   - A web application where users input their text, and it generates Renaissance-style text. This tool uses pre-defined templates or generative models to replicate the linguistic patterns of the Renaissance period, while also incorporating words and phrases that have become obsolete in modern language.
   
### 2. **Image Manipulation Pipeline**:
   - **Text Stylization**: Apply effects such as letter spacing, stylistic flourishes, and embossing.
   - **Image Superimposition**: Overlay the generated text onto a parchment-like background, using alpha_composite to simulate transparency and blending effects.
   - **Aging Effects**: Apply lighting adjustments, simulate ink bleeding, and use random mirroring and rotation to add natural imperfections.
   - **Cropping**: After superimposing the images, the final image will be cropped to match the size of the original image.

### 3. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - A simple, intuitive UI where users can input text and see it transformed into Renaissance-style text. The UI will provide options for users to adjust the output and preview the final result before downloading.

### 4. **Project Documentation**:
   - A detailed guide on how to use the tool, its components, and how to contribute to the project.

## Technical Approach

### 1. **Text Generation**:
   - **Data Collection**: Gather large amounts of text from Renaissance-era writings, including works by authors such as Shakespeare and Cervantes. Alternatively, generate contemporary Spanish text with old-fashioned words that have become obsolete in modern language.
   - **Text Processing**: Normalize the text to match the style of Renaissance writing, including spelling normalization and structural adjustments.
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use NLP models to generate historically accurate outputs, incorporating language and style typical of the Renaissance period.

### 2. **Stylized Image Generation**:
   - **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Manipulate the generated text and apply effects to simulate the appearance of ink on aged paper. This will involve adding textures, aging effects (yellowing, creases), and lighting effects (highlights and shadows) to give the text a more authentic look.
   - **Font Generation**: Either use an existing font library or create custom fonts based on historical data to replicate Renaissance-style calligraphy.

### 3. **Superimposition and Effects**:
   - **Ink Bleeds and Smudges**: Add random imperfections, such as ink bleeds and smudges, to simulate the irregularities found in hand-written manuscripts.
   - **Filters and Transformations**: Use filters to distort the text and simulate other defects like ink blotches and rotated text.

### 4. **User Interface**:
   - **Web Application**: The user interface will be built using HTML/CSS for the front-end, while the back-end will use Python (Flask or FastAPI) to process the text and generate the stylized image.
   - **Preview and Download**: Users will be able to preview the generated text and download the resulting image as a PNG or JPG.

## Python Libraries and Tools Used

- **Pillow**: For image manipulation (rotation, transformation, alpha compositing).
- **Tesseract**: For optical character recognition (OCR), if required for extracting handwritten text.
- **Flask/Django**: For creating the web-based interface (optional).
- **GANs (CycleGAN, StyleGAN2, Pix2Pix)**: For simulating material degradation and imperfections.
- **NLP Models (SLM, LLM)**: For text generation and processing.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Investigate using GANs or RNNs like AlexNet for generating realistic handwritten text from the Renaissance era.
- **Enhanced Image Transformations**: Add more complex effects like noise and textures to further simulate the imperfections of old manuscripts.
- **Multi-language Support**: Allow the generation of handwritten text in different languages, including accented characters and special symbols.
